// DRY PRINCIPLE

// DRY stands for Don't Repeat Yourself

// According to the principle:
    // reduce the repitition of code in a program
    // loops help you write DRY code
    // JavaScript functions embrace the DRY principle
    // Only write functions once



// REFACTORING is the process of improving and simplifying code without changing the code's behavior
