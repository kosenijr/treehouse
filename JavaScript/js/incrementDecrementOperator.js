//  Increment operator
//  Here's a tip. It's so common in JavaScript to increment a number value by one that there's a shorthand operator (called the "increment operator") that's used frequently with loops. Use it on your counter variable by replacing += 1 with two plus symbols (++).
 
//  Open the file do-while.js.
//  In the do block, use the increment operator to increase the number assigned to counter by one each time the loop runs:
 
//  function getRandomNumber(upper) { ... }
 
//  let counter = 0;
//  do {
//    console.log( `The random number is ${getRandomNumber(10)}` );
//    counter++; // increment operator
//  } while ( counter < 10 );
//  Similar to using the addition assignment operator and adding 1, the increment operator adds 1 to the current number value stored in counter and returns a value each time through the loop. The approach you use is up to you; the course will use the increment operator moving forward.
 
//  Decrement operator
//  JavaScript also provides the decrement operator (--), which subtracts one from an integer value. For example:
 
//  function getRandomNumber(upper) { ... }
 
//  let counter = 10;
//  do {
//    console.log( `The random number is ${getRandomNumber(10)}` );
//    counter--; // decrement operator
//  } while ( counter > 0 );
//  This time, the loop counts down from 10 to 0, decreasing the value assigned to the counter variable by one each time through the loop. It's the same as counter -= 1.
